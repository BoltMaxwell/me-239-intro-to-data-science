    "+ To introduce the cumulative distribution function and its properties.\n",

    "## Continuous random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A continuous random variable models the result of an experiment that can potentially take infinitely many values.\n",
    "That is, it is a function\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X:\\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\Omega$ is the set of all things that can happen, the so-called \"sample space.\"\n",
    "Fortunately, as we will demonstrate in this lecture, we do not have to specify exactly what the sample space $\\Omega$ is in order to speak about random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The cumulative distribution function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ be a continuous random variable.\n",
    "Its cumulative distribution function (CDF) $F_X(x)$ gives the probability that $X$ is smaller than $x$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_X(x) := \\mathbb{P}(X\\le x) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\left\\{\\omega: X(\\omega) \\le x\\right\\}\\right).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of the cumulative distribution function\n",
    "\n",
    "+ $F_X(x)$ is an increasing function.\n",
    "+ $F_X(-\\infty) = 0$.\n",
    "+ $F_X(+\\infty) = 1$.\n",
    "+ $\\mathbb{P}(a\\le X \\le b) = F_X(b) - F_X(a)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The probability density function\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability density function (PDF) is a \"function\" $f_X(x)$ that can give us the probability that $X$ is in any \"good\" subset $A$ of $\\mathbb{R}$ as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{P}(X\\in A) = \\int_A f_X(x) dx.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Note that certain random variables may not have a PDF that is a function.\n",
    "That's why I put the word \"function\" in quotes.\n",
    "However, if you allow the PDF to include Dirac's $\\delta$, then any random variable has a PDF.\n",
    "We will ignore this complication for the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we will simplify the notation and we will be writing:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x) \\equiv f_X(x),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "when there is no ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of the probability density function\n",
    "+ $p(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x$.\n",
    "+ $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(x) dx = 1$.\n",
    "+ The derivative of the CDF is the PDF, i.e., $F_X'(x) = p(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expectations of continuous random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation of a continuous random variable is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x p(x)dx.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Its properties are the same as the expectation of a discrete random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation of a function of the random variable is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[f(X)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)p(x)dx.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "It satisfies the same properties as the expectation of discrete random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variance of continuous random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance of a continuous random variable is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{V}[X] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(X-\\mathbb{E}[X]\\right)^2\\right] = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (x-\\mathbb{E}[X])^2 p(x)dx.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "It satisfies the same properties as the expectaiton of discrete andom variables."
