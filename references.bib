abstract = {Stress-strain curves in steady-state tension of aluminum 6061-T651 sourced from 9 lots of material from several manufacturers at 6 temperatures (20,100,150,200,250,300 °C) are presented. A total of 100 stress-strain curves for uniaxial tension specimens and 54 stress-strain curves for plane strain tension specimens are shared. Strains are estimated through digital image correlation using a 50.8 mm (2 inch) gauge length for the uniaxial tension specimens and a 6.35 mm (0.25 inch) gauge length for the plane strain specimens. The strains are an average of several measurements (at approximately 350-μm intervals) across the width of the gauge section.}

abstract = {The reaction pathways that lead to the formation of intermediates and final products of the reduction of nitrate on tin at high overpotential were studied in this paper. Possible chemical or electrochemical reactions of the intermediates were investigated and discussed. A complex mechanistic scheme was proposed which describes the formation of all products apart from nitrogen, even though the latter is the main electrolysis product. Several simplified reaction schemes were investigated and each fitted to experimental data using a Bayesian approach. It was concluded that in order to describe the rate of nitrogen formation, another intermediate must be considered between nitrite and nitrogen. It is finally postulated that this intermediate is nitramide; however, further work in order to develop a method for determining the nitramide concentration is required to confirm that this is indeed the precursor of nitrogen.}

abstract = {Cox’s theorem provides a theoretical basis for using probability theory as a general logic of plausible inference. The theorem states that any system for plausible reasoning that satisfies certain qualitative requirements intended to ensure consistency with classical deductive logic and correspondence with commonsense reasoning is isomorphic to probability theory. However, the requirements used to obtain this result have been the subject of much debate. We review Cox’s theorem, discussing its requirements, the intuition and reasoning behind these, and the most important objections, and finish with an abbreviated proof of the theorem.}
