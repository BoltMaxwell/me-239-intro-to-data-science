# ME 297 - Introduction to Data Science for Mechanical Engineers - Fall 2020

**Note:** This is the version of the class as taught during Fall 2020.

This is the handout and homework repository for the course "ME 297 Introduction to Data Science for Mechanical Engineers" which is currently taught (Fall 2020) by Prof. [Ilias Bilionis](https://www.predictivesciencelab.org/authors/ebilionis/) at Purdue University.
The course is fully online with the videos being accessible through [Brightspace](https://purdue.brightspace.com/).
This is an experimental course that will likely evolve into a requirement for all Purdue Mechanical Engineering students.

## Running the notebooks on Google Colab

Make sure you have a Google account before you start.
Then, you just click on the links above.

## Converting your homework notebooks to PDF on Google Colab

One solution is to "print" your notebook to a PDF.
However, we have observed that sometimes the figures get a bit messed up.
One solution is to run the notebooks on your own laptop, and the do "File-> Download as-> PDF via Latex (.pdf)."
See below if you want to take that route.
Now, it is possible to do the same thing on Google Colab.
Follow the instructions in [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PurdueMechanicalEngineering/me-297-intro-to-data-science/blob/master/activities/notebook_conversion.ipynb).

## Running the notebooks on your personal computer

Find and download the right version of
[Anaconda for Python 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution) from Continuum Analytics.
This package contains most of the software we are going to need.
**Note:** You do need Python 3 and note Python 2. The notebooks will not work
with Python 2.

### OS Specific Instructions

#### Microsoft Windows

+ We need C, C++, Fortran compilers, as well as the Python sources.
Start the command line by opening "Anaconda Prompt" from the
start menu. In the command line type:
```
conda config --append channels https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free
conda install mingw libpython
```
+ Finally, you need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). As you install it,
make sure to indicate that you want to use "Git from the command line and
also from 3rd party software".

#### Apple OS X

+ Download and install the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/).

#### Linux

If you are using Linux, I am sure that you can figure it out on your own.

### Installation of Required Python Packages

Independently of the operating system, use the command line to install the following Python packages:
+ [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/), for beautiful graphics:
```
conda install seaborn
```

+ [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/) for MCMC sampling:
```
conda install pymc3
```

+ [GPy](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy) for Gaussian process regression:
```
pip install GPy
```

+ [pydoe](https://pythonhosted.org/pyDOE/randomized.html) for generating experimental designs:
```
pip install pydoe
```

+ [fipy](https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/) for solving partial differential equations using the finite volume method:
```
pip install fipy
```
*** Windows Users ***

You may receive the error
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'future'
```
If so, please install future and then install fipy:
```
pip install future
```

+ [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for some standard machine learning algorithms implemented in Python:
```
conda install scikit-learn
```

+ [graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/download/) for visualizing probabilistic graphical models:
```
pip install graphviz
```

### Running the notebooks

+ Open the command line.
+ `cd` to your favorite folder.
+ Then, type:
```
git clone https://github.com/PurdueMechanicalEngineering/me-297-intro-to-data-science.git
```
+ This will download the contents of this repository in a folder called `me-297-intro-to-data-science`.
+ Enter the ``me-297-intro-to-data-science`` folder:
```
cd me-297-intro-to-data-science
```
+ Start the jupyter notebook by typing the command:
```
jupyter notebook
```
+ Use the browser to navigate the course, experiment with code etc.
+ If the course content has been updated, type the following command (while being inside `me-297-intro-to-data-science`) to get the latest version:
```
git pull origin master
```
Keep in mind, that if you have made local changes to the repository, you may have to commit them before moving on.
